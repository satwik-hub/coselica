  for modeling of kinematic loops. Hint: Use exactly three of these joints
  in every loop!

  for measurements resolved in an arbitrary frame
- added Planar.Sensors.{AbsAngle,AbsAngularVelocity,AbsAngularAcceleration}
- added Planar.Sensors.{AbsPosition,AbsVelocity,AbsAcceleration}
  and variants (i.e. AbsPosition2, AbsVelocity2, and AbsAcceleration2)

  blocks for revolute and prismatic joints and rigid bodies with mass and
  inertia. Currently it allows modeling and simulation of OPEN kinematic
  chains only
- added simplified Multiplex2, DeMultiplex2 blocks to deal with 2-dimensional
  signals from sensors like Planar.Sensors.{CutForce,RelPosition,RelVelocity,
  RelAcceleration}
- added examples/tests Pendulum, DoublePendulum, CartWithPendulum

  SpeedSensor, AccSensor, ForceSensor} have changed, thus existing scicos
  diagrams containing these blocks have to be updated
- updated examples/tests (ElastoGap, IdealGearR2T, MassWithFriction,
  MassWithFrictionAndStop, StickSlipOscillation,
  TranslationalForcedMovement)
- fixed bug of ElastoGap,ElastoBacklash according to MSL 3.0.1
- GUI function name of ElastoGap, ElastoBacklash has changed, thus existing
  diagrams have to be updated
- added example/test ElastoBacklash

======================

- rewritten and improved (?) components with Coulomb friction and Stribeck
  effect (Translational.{MassWithFriction,Stop}, Rotational.BearingFriction)

Version 0.3.2 -> 0.3.3

  StickSlipOscillation,BearingFriction)

Version 0.3.1 -> 0.3.2
======================

- fixed bug 012
- fixed bug 007:  modified Translational.Position, Rotational.{Position,Speed},
  now they are NOT filtering any input signal. We might add variants of these
  blocks w/ filtering, if there is a need for that.
- added Translational.Speed (/wo filtering)
- physical units of parameters are now shown in setup dialogs
- added Math.{TwoInputs,TwoOutputs,Atan2}
- added example/test ArcTangent

Version 0.3 -> 0.3.1
====================

- fixed bugs 009, 010

- added example/test MinMax

Version 0.2.2 -> 0.3
====================

  (new connectors/blocks RealInput, RealOutput) which is incompatible
  with previous versions of Coselica
