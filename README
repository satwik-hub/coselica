Coselica Toolbox (Version 0.4.3)
=================================

Coselica Toolbox provides about 200 basic Xcos Modelica blocks for
modeling and simulation of electrical (analog), mechanical (1D-translational,
1D-rotational, and 2D-planar) and thermodynamical (0/1D-heattransfer) systems.
Almost all of these blocks have been derived from the Modelica
Standard Library 2.2.

WARNING: This toolbox is in an early stage of development! It is incomplete,
undocumented, not well tested and it may contain numerous and severe bugs!
