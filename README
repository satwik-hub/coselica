Coselica Toolbox for ScicosLab (Version 0.4.2)
==============================================

Coselica Toolbox provides about 200 basic Sci[cos] Mod[elica] blocks for
modeling and simulation of electrical (analog), mechanical (1D-translational,
1D-rotational, and 2D-planar) and thermodynamical (0/1D-heattransfer) systems
in ScicosLab. Almost all of these blocks have been derived from the Modelica
Standard Library 2.2.

WARNING: This toolbox is in an early stage of development! It is incomplete,
undocumented, not well tested and it may contain numerous and severe bugs!

Requirements
============

- Linux/Windows
- ScicosLab 4.3

Installation
============

To Install this toolbox:

We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for  the path of the directory
containing this readme.txt file.

- On Unix/Linux systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/builder.sce 
        This operation requires a C compiler and permission to
        write in 
        - <PATH>/sci_gateway to generate Makefile *.o, toto.a  files 
        - <PATH>/macros to generate *.bin, names and lib files
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/loader.sce 
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.

- On Windows systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\builder.sce 
        This operation requires VisualC++ compiler and permission to
        write in 
         - <PATH>\src to generate Makefile *.obj, *.dll, ... files 
         - <PATH>\macros to generate *.bin, names and lib files 
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\loader.sce
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.
